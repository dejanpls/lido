## Introduction

This website provides information about the restaurant, including the menu, reservation option, and general contact details.  It demonstrates a simple approach to dynamic content rendering using JavaScript and Webpack.

When a user clicks on a navigation tab (Home, Make a Reservation, or Menu), the corresponding content is loaded and displayed without requiring a full page reload.

## Features

* **Dynamic Content Loading:**  Content for each section (Home, Reservation, Menu) is loaded dynamically when the user clicks the corresponding tab.
* **Home Page:**  Displays a welcome message, restaurant image, and brief description.
* **Reservation Page:**  Provides a telephone number and information on how to make a reservation.
* **Menu Page:**  Showcases the restaurant's menu items, with categories and descriptions.
* **Webpack Bundling:**  Uses Webpack to bundle and optimize the website's assets for efficient loading.
* **Clean and Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be visually appealing on desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:**  Structure of the website.
* **CSS:**  Styling of the website.
* **JavaScript:**  Dynamic content loading and interactivity.
* **Webpack:**  Module bundler.
